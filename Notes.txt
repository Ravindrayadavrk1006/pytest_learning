1.  for running class based test with setup_method and teardown_method we have to run like
    file_name -s      -> -s is setup

2.  pytest.fixtures are constants which we can define and pass them in the test_functions see test_rectangle.py for it

3. if you want to store fixtures in a separate file then create a file named conftest.py and store all the fixtures there

4. we can pass lot of parameter to test the functions called parameterized see test_square.py

5. we can mock or mimic the real scenarios using the mock.patch for reference test_service.py
